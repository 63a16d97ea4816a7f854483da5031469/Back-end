 Solved: “npm: command not found” (3.11.2014)
After upgrading to OS X Yosemite I noticed that my npm (installed using brew) didn’t work anymore. I tried to check the PATH variable and double-checked that I have my npm installed. This all seemed to be fine.

Then I decided to try the trick that has worked with somewhat all of my past npm-related issues: I deleted ~/.npm folder. It worked. So here’s what I did.

cd ~
sudo rm -rf .npm
brew update
brew uninstall npm
brew install npm
